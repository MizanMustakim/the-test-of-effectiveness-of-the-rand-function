# the-test-of-effectiveness-of-the-rand-function
Write a program that tests the effectiveness of the rand( ) function provided by your compiler. Start by initializing 10 counters, such as onescount, twoscount to tenscount, all to 0. Then generate a large number of random integers between 1 and 10. Each time a 1 occurs, increment onescount; when a 2 occurs, increment twoscount; etc. Finally， print out the number of 1s，2s，etc. that occurred and the percentage of the time each number occurred.
